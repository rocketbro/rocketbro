# Codebase Cleanup Progress

## Overall Assessment
**Grade: B-/C+** - Good foundation with solid architecture that needs refactoring pass to remove duplication and improve code quality. Definitely worth iterating on rather than starting over.

## Completed ✅

### 1. Extract Shared Footer Component
- Created `components/Footer.tsx` with reusable footer component
- Removed duplicate footer code from `app/page.tsx` and `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Eliminated ~25 lines of duplicate code

### 2. Clean Up Excessive Webhook Logging
- Reduced `app/api/revalidate/route.ts` from 138 lines to 55 lines (60% reduction)
- Kept essential error logging for debugging
- Maintained all functionality while improving readability

### 3. Properly Type Portable Text Values
- Added `PortableTextContent` and `IntroTextContent` type aliases in `lib/sanity/types.ts`
- Updated `components/PortableTextRenderer.tsx` with proper types
- Removed all `eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` comments (3 files)
- Removed all `as any` type casts
- Added null check in PortableTextRenderer
- All TypeScript checks passing with no errors

## Remaining Cleanup Tasks

### 4. Create Constants File for Image Dimensions
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: Low**

Currently image dimensions are hardcoded throughout:
- `urlFor(image).width(1200).height(630)` - OG images
- `urlFor(image).width(800).height(450)` - Post card images
- `urlFor(image).width(64).height(64)` - Author avatars
- `urlFor(image).width(40).height(40)` - Small avatars

**Action Items:**
- Create `lib/constants.ts` file
- Define `IMAGE_SIZES` constant object
- Replace all magic numbers with named constants

**Suggested Structure:**
```typescript
export const IMAGE_SIZES = {
  OG: { width: 1200, height: 630 },
  POST_CARD: { width: 800, height: 450 },
  POST_FEATURED: { width: 1200, height: 675 },
  AVATAR_LARGE: { width: 96, height: 96 },
  AVATAR_MEDIUM: { width: 64, height: 64 },
  AVATAR_SMALL: { width: 40, height: 40 },
} as const;
```

### 5. Add Error Boundary
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: Medium**

**Action Items:**
- Create `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Wrap application in error boundary at layout level
- Create user-friendly error UI
- Add error logging/reporting

### 6. Review LayoutContent Usage
**Priority: Low** | **Effort: Low**

Currently `LayoutContent` wraps children, but pages have embedded nav/footer. This creates potential confusion about layout responsibility.

**Action Items:**
- Review `components/LayoutContent.tsx` and `components/TopNav.tsx`
- Consider whether nav should be in LayoutContent or pages
- Ensure consistent layout structure

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

### 7. Add Loading States
- Create loading skeletons for post cards
- Add loading UI for blog post pages
- Consider using Next.js 15 `loading.tsx` convention

### 8. Create Custom 404 Page
- Create `app/not-found.tsx` with custom design
- Add helpful navigation back to home
- Match site theme and branding

### 9. Improve Accessibility
- Add proper ARIA landmarks where missing
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- Test with screen reader
- Add skip-to-content link

### 10. Add Testing
- Set up Jest + React Testing Library
- Add component tests for shared components
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Consider E2E tests with Playwright

## Files Modified in This Session
- ✅ `components/Footer.tsx` (created)
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` (updated to use Footer component, removed any casts)
- ✅ `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (updated to use Footer component, removed any casts)
- ✅ `app/api/revalidate/route.ts` (reduced logging verbosity)
- ✅ `lib/sanity/types.ts` (added Portable Text type aliases)
- ✅ `components/PortableTextRenderer.tsx` (properly typed, removed any usage)

## Next Session Recommendations
Start with **Task #4 (Constants File)** as it's a quick win that improves maintainability and removes magic numbers throughout the codebase.
